# Image-Classification

The  aim is to develop a model using images from a training dataset that can: 1) Accurately classify a given image from a testing dataset into different diseased categories or a healthy leaf; 2) Accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on a single leaf; 3) Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms; 4) Address depth perception—angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf; and 5) Incorporate expert knowledge in identification.
